#### Description:

    The longterm goal is to create a nationwide repositary of legal statutes in the United States,
    comprising all administative levels.
    That's the mission of the larger project. This website, LegalimitGC, initial aim was to
    flag "junk" laws that have more or less "expired". The initial idea occurring to me a couple years ago in Seattle during
    the nationwide protests. I thought, "wouldn't it be of use to have a nationwide database of laws" so that anyone could
    quickly search and flag anachronistic laws, discriminatory, inneficient, or redundant laws, for example.

    My initial intent was to use api's for more penetrating searches and analysis.
    But I couldn't find any dedicated to nation-wide statutes. The Harvard Caselaw Access Project, as the name suggests,
    has one for caselaws. And the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics (CODEX) lists a project called "Corpus Legis" in their
    projects current projects directory, but the link leads to a 404.

    So I ended up needing to craft something useful concerning the initial idea, with the tools available. I settled on a website that
    allows you to search and research U.S. statutes at the three main levels of administation - local, state, federal -; input relevant
    info for each statute into a personal record database that allows edits, expanded statute text view, and deletion of records.
    The final product is a pretty helpful research aid, with solid aesthetics. A slight compromise of goals, but definitely a good start.

    I used the "Homepage" pset exercise to build out the hmtl/css frame of this cite,
    and "Finance" for the user account related Python features.
    The record edit/delete features are a significant expansion of those
    I built for the "Birthdays" pset. The javascript implementation is all my own.
    I used the house.gov for Federal codes; Cornell Law School Legal Inforamation Institute website for State;
    and municode website for Local.

    Below is the homepage text of LegalimitGC:

    Laws are policies. Like policies, they are designed to carry out a mission. When the mission is complete, null-and-void,
    redundant or the pursuit of such is no longer tenable, the policy is scrubbed.
    Sunset clauses need to be a more active function in the life cycle of a law.
    This website aims to identify statutes for scrub review. Just as memory leaks are an issue with any computer program,
    junk laws impede optimal performance of the legal system.

    The legal system of the United States is variegated, but clearly so.
    Laws at the Federal, State and Local levels will have a precedure for their expungement.
    If you suspect a law has expired, this website aims to be your first step in initiating a course for its removal.

    Begin your search in the top or side navagtion panes.
    After you've located the target statute, enter its details on the Submit page;
    this will create a record of your search.
    On the Portfolio page you can then access a list of your records,
    where they can be edited, deleted, or expanded for full statute text view.
